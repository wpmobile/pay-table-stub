  description: "# Summary\n  Given set of APIs for Bill management process\n# Versioning\n\
    \  By default, all requests receive the latest version of the REST API.  We encourage\
    \ you to explicitly request this version via the Accept header. Example \n   \
    \          \n  \"Accept: application/vnd.worldpay.bill-v1+json\"\n  \n# Security\
    \ \nAPIs use JWT Based Bearer Authentication. JWT Token must contain claims to\
    \ merchant and terminal operator identifiers at minimum.\n\n# Response Codes \n\
    \nA list of the  common HTTP response codes used in POS API is given below:\n\n\
    \  |HTTP Code|HTTP Verb|Description|\n  |--- |--- |--- |\n  |200|GET POST PUT|The\
    \ request has succeeded.|\n  |201|POST|The request has succeeded and a new resource\
    \ has been created as a result.|\n  |202|GET POST|The request has succeeded, but\
    \ the response body is incomplete.|\n  |204|PUT DELETE|The request has succeeded,\
    \ an existing resource has been updated/deleted and the response body is empty.|\n\
    \  |400|POST PUT|The service could not understand the request.|\n  |401|Any|The\
    \ client must authenticate itself.|\n  |404|GET PUT DELETE|The service can not\
    \ find requested resource.|\n  |409|POST|The service has experienced a conflict\
    \ between the data provided in the request and the data on file.|\n  |415|Any|Content-Type\
    \ and/or Accept headers are missing or invalid|\n  |422|Any|The request was well-formed\
    \ but could not be processed due to semantic errors.|\n  |500|Any|An error occurred\
    \ within the service which hasn’t been accounted for.|\n  |503|Any|The service\
    \ is not ready to handle the request.|\n\n# Errors  \n\nThe response contains\
    \ an errorName that is both human-readable and machine-readable, with a human-readable\
    \ message to add context to help you diagnose the error.\n\nIf there are multiple\
    \ errors, the response includes all the errors in a nested list within the top-level\
    \ error.\n\n### Generic Error Format  \n```\n{\n  \"errorName\": \"errorName\"\
    ,\n  \"message\": \"human readable message\"\n}\n```\n\n### Specific Error Format\
    \  \n \nValidation errors must also contain a path to the location of the value\
    \ that caused the error. The field to use here depends on whether the error ocurred\
    \ on the URL or in the JSON request body:\n \n```\n{\n  \"errorName\": \"bodyDoesNotMatchSchema\"\
    ,\n  \"message\": \"The json body provided does not match the expected schema\"\
    ,\n  \"validationErrors\": [\n      {\n        \"errorName\": \"fieldMustBeNumber\"\
    ,\n        \"message\": \"Field at path must be a number\",\n        \"jsonPath\"\
    : \"$.amount\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n"

            A token representing a card used in a payment. This will be returned in the result of a card payment if tokenisation is enabled, and can be sent in the request for payment with a `card/token` payment instrument. The following token formats are supported: * **Alphanumeric token** – this token uses an alternating sequence of upper case letters and numbers, and is always 15 digits long. The letters I and O are never used due to their similarity with numbers. Useful if you do not require a numeric token, and prefer the token  to be clearly distinguished from card numbers. * **Wrapped luhn fail token** – this token consists of between 16 and 21 digits, and the first two digits are always 99. These tokens will not pass through luhn (modulus 10) checks. Useful if you want to avoid possible issues with regard to PCI DSS compliance checks, because tokens will not be mistaken for a card number. * **Wrapped luhn pass token** – this token consists of between 16 and 21 digits, and the first two digits are always 99. These tokens will pass through luhn (modulus 10) checks. Useful if you have system validation that requires your token to be similar to a card number. * **Format preserving token** – this token uses a part of the card number used to create it, and is always 20 digits long. The first two digits are always 99. The next six digits are the first six numbers on the card used. The final four digits are the last four numbers on the card used.

        A token representing a card used in a payment. This will be returned in the result of a card payment if tokenisation is enabled, and can be sent in the request for payment with a `card/token` payment instrument. The following token formats are supported: * **Alphanumeric token** – this token uses an alternating sequence of upper case letters and numbers, and is always 15 digits long. The letters I and O are never used due to their similarity with numbers. Useful if you do not require a numeric token, and prefer the token  to be clearly distinguished from card numbers. * **Wrapped luhn fail token** – this token consists of between 16 and 21 digits, and the first two digits are always 99. These tokens will not pass through luhn (modulus 10) checks. Useful if you want to avoid possible issues with regard to PCI DSS compliance checks, because tokens will not be mistaken for a card number. * **Wrapped luhn pass token** – this token consists of between 16 and 21 digits, and the first two digits are always 99. These tokens will pass through luhn (modulus 10) checks. Useful if you have system validation that requires your token to be similar to a card number. * **Format preserving token** – this token uses a part of the card number used to create it, and is always 20 digits long. The first two digits are always 99. The next six digits are the first six numbers on the card used. The final four digits are the last four numbers on the card used.
